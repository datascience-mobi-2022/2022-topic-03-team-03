**Abstract** -- Unraveling the protein-RNA interactome poses a highly dynamic field of research. Several approaches were undertaken and numerous RNA-binding and RNA-interacting proteins have been identified. Harnessing bioinformatics and statistical analysis, we propose a simple and swift way to screen RNA-protein interactome data for RNA-binding proteins obtained by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation. We included t-tests, k-means, and linear regression modeling in our analysis. These methods' efficiency is proven by successfully identifying MCM3 as a potential RBP. This was possible because our unique data set consists of HeLa cells synchronized in the interphase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, we confirmed the detection of other previously identified RPBs.
